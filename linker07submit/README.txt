This program works perfectly on my ubuntu 16.04 computer.

For compile, type just "make" or "g++ linker.cpp -o linker".
I will generate linker. And then type "  ./linker input-1  ".
The output result will be save in outdir folder. The outdir foler should be 
in same folder with this README.txt.

Thank you very much
